Data-driven Story Map analyzing the growth and spatial distribution of EV charging stations in Washington State.
# The Growth of EV Charging Stations in Washington State

## Overview
This project explores the growth and spatial distribution of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across Washington State. Using geographic and tabular data, the Story Map examines regional trends, accessibility, and infrastructure development related to EV adoption.

## Research Question
How has EV charging infrastructure expanded across Washington State, and what spatial patterns or accessibility gaps are visible?

## Data Sources
- Washington State EV charging station datasets
- Geographic boundary and basemap data from ArcGIS Online

## Methods
- Spatial analysis of EV charging station locations
- Geographic visualization using ArcGIS StoryMaps
- Integration of maps, charts, and narrative to communicate trends

## Key Insights
- EV charging infrastructure has increased substantially over time
- Charging stations are concentrated in urban and high-population regions
- Some rural and underserved areas show limited access to charging infrastructure
